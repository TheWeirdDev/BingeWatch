# :hammer_and_wrench: Build
You need `ldc` and `dub` installed on your system.

First get your themoviedb.org API_KEY from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

Then Add it to [source/config.d:7](source/config.d#L7):

```D
static {
    // REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN API KEY
    immutable API_KEY = "";
}
```

And then compile and run the program:

```bash
cd BingeWatch
dub --compiler=ldc
```
